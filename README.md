# Medical Classification Problem Solving Framework

## Project Overview
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) encompass patient-related information and have significantly contributed to developing predictive models in the healthcare field. However, inevitable missing values in EHRs pose a difficulty to explore underlying patterns, limiting the capacity and effectiveness of most machine learning methods. In this paper, we focus on EHRs with missing values, and propose Mixture of Subclassifiers with complete Submatrix (MoSS) to tolerate missing values rather than conducting deletion or imputation on the raw data.
